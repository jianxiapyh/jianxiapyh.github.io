Thanks for stopping by!

I am a recently graduated M.S. student in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech, where I work with professor Binoy Ravindran in the <a href="https://www.ssrg.ece.vt.edu">System Software Research Group(SSRG)</a>.
My research interests lie in the general area of computer architecture and system.

I received a B.S. in Computer Engineering from Virginia Tech.
