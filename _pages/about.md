Thanks for stopping by!

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I work with Professor Sarita Adve. 

My research focuses on energy-efficient systems for extended reality (XR). 

I received my B.S. and M.S. in Computer Engineering from Virginia Tech.
