# Technical Interview Preparation

##  The Process

Most high paying companies have similar interview interview process which looks something like this:

- A coding challenge
  - One or two questions. Mostly less than 4
  - Companies use platform like hackerrank etc
  - Question difficult vary from company to company
- Phone interviews
  - One or two phone interview.
  - Usually 45-60 min long
  - One or two questions asked.
- Onsite Interview
  - Usually day long process
  - 4-5 Interviews with one hour lunch break
  - All interview can be coding (like in google) or one interview can be with manager (non coding but technical)

## When to apply

You should apply a semester before you graduate. Eg. if you are graduating in spring, then you should applying beginning of fall (August-September). 

## Resources

- Unfortunately, most high paying jobs are gated by "Leetcode style" coding interview.
- You will be given a problem and you have to write code to solve the problem in the language of your choice
- Irrespective of your level of expertise, I will suggest you to start with ["**Cracking the Coding Interview**"](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X)
- Once you have complete this book practice questions on [Leetcode](leetcode.com)
  - Select Top interview question problem set
  - Sort the problem set by difficult
  - Go through questions one by one
  - Doing easy and medium should be sufficient
- You can use this list if you want to practice for specific question using this [repo](https://github.com/rrevanth/leetcode-by-company)
- Practice mock interviews with friend using white board
- Usually system design questions are not asked to new grads but it depends on the specific role you are interviewing. Some resources to practice the same

  - Most companies give a school id which helps your resume to reach the right recruiter
- Ask for referrals

  - Easiest way to get past resume screen and get at least a phone screen
- Your resume should be one page long.
  - Have interesting projects in your resume
  - Get your resume reviewed by a technical person if possible
