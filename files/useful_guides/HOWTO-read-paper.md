# HOWTO read papers

## Why should you read papers?
- To learn new knowledge
	- understand what it is
- To search your research topic
	- find what are missing in the paper
- To prepare your paper submission
	- test whether your paper is still competitive after reading the
      paper
- To stimulate your brain
	- discover new perspective for the same problem
- Just for fun

## How many papers should I read?
- How many papers are publishing a year in your field?
	- 400 papers per year
- Systems research: about 400 papers per year
	- 10 top-tier conferences * 40 papers
	- OSDI/SOSP, ATC, EuroSys, ASPLOS, FAST, PPoPP, NSDI, SIGMOD, VLDB,
      PLDI, SIGCOM, ISCA, MICRO, PACT, SoCC, etc
- Security research: about 400 papers per year
	- 4 top-tier conferences * 100 papers

## Effective paper reading for a new area
- If you are reading papers on new to you, you first understand the
  landscape to understand common terms, key idea of major research,
  what are important aspects in the area.
- First, read lecture slides.
	- Good instructors deliver organized knowledge for newbies to
      easily catch up.
	- They covers the classic, important papers, which is common
      ground of the area.
- Second, read papers covered in the graduate-level advanced (seminar)
  classes.
	- There are two types of seminar classes: one is designed to cover
      historically important papers (e.g., micro-kernel, exokernel,
      spin in OS design) and another is designed to address new
      important papers (e.g., Multikernel, Arrakis).
	- Find out what are historically important ones and recently
      important ones and read some of them.
- Third, check out papers published in the top-tier conferences
  published within three years in the area
    - Check out the most recent research interest of the area

## Effective paper reading for your area
- Do not read any random paper
	- Priorities are top-tier conference papers followed by very
      good workshop papers (e.g., HotOS, HotStorage, HotCloud, SoCC,
      Systor, ApSYS), industry conference presentations (e.g.,
      Linux Plumbers Conference, BlackHat), and top-tier journal
      papers (e.g., TOCS, TC, TPDS, TOS).
- Read interactively
	- First read abstract, introduction, and conclusion
	- Then **stop** reading the paper and try to answer following
      questions:
	- *Q1: Why is the problem that the paper is trying to solve important?*
	- *Q2: How will you solve the problem?*
	- *Q3: How is this related to your problem?*
- Read critically
	- After reading the paper to the end, ask following questions:
	- *Q4: What are main claims of the paper?*
	- *Q5: Are all the claims are backed by evaluation results?*
	- *Q6: Is there any result that is not explained or is contradict
      to the claims?*
	- *Q7: What are not considered? How can you improve this?*

## After reading the paper, summarize it
- Spend 5 minutes to summarize it including:
	- Short summary of the paper (1-2 sentences)
	- Short summary of the problem (1-2 sentences)
	- Pros and cons of the paper
	- One new idea to extend this paper

## In a month later, review your summary
- Review your summary to discover your cool idea in a new context
